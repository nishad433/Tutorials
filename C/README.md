-I <include directory>
-L <library directory>
-l <library name>
The include directory will be location of the header files. The library directory will be the location of the library (.a or .so), and the library name will be the name of the library file, without the leading 'lib' prefix or its extension (i.e. -lsal rather than -l libsal.a ).
